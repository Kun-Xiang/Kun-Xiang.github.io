Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹


I am currently a research assistant at the [HCP-I2 Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net) in Sun Yat-sen University advised by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/) on Multimodal Large Language Model. Grounded in data-centric perspective, our work aims to build generalizable AI systems. Previously, I obtained both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Engineering from the School of Intelligent Engineering at Sun Yat-sen University under the supervision of [Prof. Shancheng Jiang](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/teacher02/1415334.htm), concentrating on Trustworthy Machine Learning and Computer Aided Diagnosis System.

Currently, I am interested in the higher-order reasoning abilities of MLLMs. I am working to answer: *1) Does more inference time always result in better performance? 2) How can we search for optimal thinking strategies?*
