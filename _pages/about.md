Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹


I am currently a PhD student at the [HCP-I2 Lab](https://www.sysu-hcp.net) in Sun Yat-sen University advised by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://lemondan.github.io/). Grounded in data-centric perspective, our work aims to build generalizable symbolic reasoning systems. Previously, I obtained both a Bachelor's and Master's degree at SYSU under the supervision of [Prof. Shancheng Jiang](https://ise.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/teacher02/1415334.htm), concentrating on Trustworthy Models and Computer Aided Diagnosis System.

Currently, I am interested in solving the higher-order reasoning problems with physics and physical engine. I am working to answer: *1) How can we search for optimal thinking strategies? 2) How to use symbolic engine to solve symbolic physics questions?*
